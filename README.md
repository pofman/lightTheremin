# Arduino Theremin with phototransistor and temperature sensor

## Intro

Theremin project uses an arduino UNO / micro to play tones based on temperature and light level measured by the phototransistor.
For this you will require
* Arduino UNO / micro
* Phototransistor
* Temperature sensor
* 10Kohm resistor
* Piezo (to play the notes)
